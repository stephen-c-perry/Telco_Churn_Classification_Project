This repo is for my first complete data science project.  I'll be using the telco churn dataset to predict customer churn.

1) project description with goals

- Follow the data science pipeline (data acquistion, data preparation, exploratory data analysis and statistical testing, modeling, and model evaluation) and document code, findings, and keytakeaways and deliver a jupyter notebook final report

- Create modules (acquire.py, prepare.py) that make your process repeatable and your report (notebook) easier to read and follow.

- Ask exploratory questions of your data that will help you understand more about the attributes and drivers of customers churning. Answer questions through charts and statistical tests.

- Construct a model to predict customer churn using classification techniques, and make predictions for a group of customers.

- Refine your work into a Report, in the form of a jupyter notebook, that you will walk through in a 5 minute presentation to a group of collegues and managers about the work you did, why, goals, what you found, your methdologies, and your conclusions.

- Be prepared to answer panel questions about your code, process, findings and key takeaways, and model.


2) initial hypotheses and/or questions you have of the data, ideas



3) data dictionary



4) project planning (lay out your process through the data science pipeline)




5) instructions or an explanation of how someone else can reproduce your project and findings (What would someone need to be able to recreate your project on their own?)



6) key findings, recommendations, and takeaways from your project.
